# Filtering-application-on-images-in-frequency-domain
This involves filtering a number of images after applying the fourier transform to display the spectrum of these images in the frequency domain.
We calculated the Fourier transform on several original images taken in a loop to respectively display the spectra of each of
these images in the frequency domain.

We calculated the inverse Fourier transform on the spectra obtained previously to obtain the different original images in the spacial domain.
# Low pass filter and high pass filter
# Low pass filter
We have defined the mask of our filter in circular form, so the radius of this mask determines the cutoff frequency of our filter. We took two values ​​for the cutoff frequencies
# high pass filter
Here we have also defined a filter mask in the form of a circle whose radius determines the cutoff frequency. We therefore considered two
cutoff frequencies.
